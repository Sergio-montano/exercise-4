      <h2>History of Elon Musk</h2>
      <p>  </p>
      <p class="middle"> Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. 

        Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.
        
        In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world. </p>
      <p> At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.

        In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.
        
        
        After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002. </p>

      <h2>History of SpaceX</h2>
      <p> SpaceX was formed by entrepreneur Elon Musk in the hopes of revolutionizing the aerospace industry and making affordable spaceflight a reality. The company entered the arena with the Falcon 1 rocket, a two-stage liquid-fueled craft designed to send small satellites into orbit. The Falcon 1 was vastly cheaper to build and operate than its competitors, a field largely populated by spacecraft built by publicly owned and government-funded companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Part of the rocket’s cost-effectiveness was made possible by the SpaceX-developed Merlin engine, a cheaper alternative to those used by other companies. SpaceX also focused on making reusable rockets (other launch vehicles are generally made for one-time use).

        <p class="middle"> In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse containing seeds with dehydrated gel on Mars to grow plants on Martian soil, "so this would be the furthest that life's ever traveled"[1] in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the budget of NASA But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive without a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology.[2] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into space.

          The group met with companies such as Lavochkin and ISC Kosmotras. However, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and the group returned to the US empty-handed.[6] In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing Mike Griffin, who had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and was just leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. However, this was seen by Musk as too expensive and Musk left the meeting. While on the return flight Musk realized that he could start a company which could build the affordable rockets he needed.6 According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[7] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time.<div></div> By applying vertical integration—principally for cost reasons; around 85% of the entire Falcon/Dragon vehicle is produced in-house and the modular approach from software engineering (Falcon 9 uses 9 of the Merlin engines, which were tested on the single-engine Falcon 1, Falcon Heavy uses three Falcon 9 booster stages), SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin. Another reason for vertical integration was Musk's belief that reusable rockets could not be built with components from existing aerospace suppliers.[citation needed] For example, SpaceX had to design a machine that could friction stir weld aluminum-lithium alloy for the airframe of the Falcon 9 because such a machine did not exist.[11] According to Musk SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket (Falcon 1 with about half a ton to orbit) instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company. </p>

      <h2>spaceX seven steps to Success</h2>
      <p class="middle"> 1. SpaceX has an inspiring vision
        An inspiring vision and a charismatic leader are the two initial essentials for the seven steps of strategic process success. SpaceX’s vision is “The road to making humanity multi-planetary”. Elon Musk blends charisma and passion to bring his company’s vision to life, and to take others on his journey. The vision is brief, to the point, memorable and instantly compelling.
        <br>
        <br>2. The purpose is clear
        To the vision, Musk adds his purpose: “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great – and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.” The purpose sets the intention and direction for the entire company and explains exactly why it exists; again, whilst creating a powerful sense of excitement, drive and direction.
        <br>
        <br>3. There is a clear sense of prioritisation
        Musk knows exactly what needs doing and he has a plan that has been developed by experts in his field. There is a clear recognition of the activities that are priorities, and an order to play to get them done. This strategic step is essential to drive success in all businesses, whether you are sending men to space or running an e-commerce enterprise. The collective energy and productivity of the organisation must be organised in a way that best achieves its stated objectives.
        <br>
        <br>4. The vision has been translated into believable objectives
        In the case of SpaceX, this has involved delivering a series of critical projects that build the necessary spacecraft components, test efficacy with cargo payload flights into space, and then progress to sending astronauts into space. The next phase is to send people – commercial passengers – to the moon, and beyond. The objectives are:
        <br>
       <br> – build the propulsion system (Falcon Heavy)
        – build reusable components (Falcon 9)
        – send payloads into space (Dragon)
        – send astronauts into space (Dragon)
        – send people to the moon, Mars and beyond (Starship)
        
        As you can see, although the projects in themselves are awesomely ambitious, their scope is clear and they are logically sequenced to build upon the successful delivery of each prior milestone.
     <br>
       <br> 5. Excellent communication has been used to gain buy-in
        The Human Rideshare is the outcome of superb communication and engagement by SpaceX – resulting in commercial participation via the Human Rideshare scheme, which will allow passengers to buy their seat on a future flight to space. SpaceX uses talented communicators and marketers to build its brand and to communicate effectively with a wide range of stakeholders.
        <br>
        <br>6. Every activity has been measured
        The company measures its activities and outputs in meticulous detail. This allows it to chart progress and success, to reallocate resources as required and to adjust tasks as required in a timely fashion. By ensuring that every management decision is driven by data, decisions are made on the back of accurate, up to date information, supporting the best possible outcomes.
        <br>
       <br> 7. The best tools have been used, and processes have been automated
        Elon Musk is known for his passion for technology; seeing it as the great enabler for breaking new ground and using it extensively at every level of his company. With SpaceX, he is able to put his knowledge and vision into practice, by ensuring that the company uses the best tools available and that it automates and measures the business as far as possible. This automation makes everything faster, more efficient and more accurate – reducing human error and minimising waste. </p>
